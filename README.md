# Simple-AD

## Overview

Simple AD is an open source Active Directory management tool-set designed to provide more options for administering active directory domains. Its key goal is to make bulk operations within active directory allot more accessible for those shy of Powershell.

This project is being developed as part of a personal venture into learning .Net and object-oriented programming. As such the source is highly volatile and may be subject to drastic changes as I become more compliant in structuring the code base.

Simple AD is currently built against .Net 4.6.2
